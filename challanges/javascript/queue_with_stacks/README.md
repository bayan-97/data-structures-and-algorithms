# Stacks and Queues
1. A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.
2. Similar to a stack, a queue is a linear data structure. Unlike a stack, a queue deletes only the oldest added data.

## Challenge
Create a brand new PseudoQueue class. this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface , but will internally only utilize 2 Stack objects. methods:

enqueue(value) which inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
dequeue() which extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.

## Approach & Efficiency

## API
enqueue(value) which inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
dequeue() which extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
