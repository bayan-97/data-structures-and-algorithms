# tree
- Node - A node is the individual item/data that makes up the data structure Root - The root is the first/top Node in the tree Left Child - The node that is positioned to the left of a root or node Right Child - The node that is positioned to the right of a root or node Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not contain any children Height - The height of a tree is determined by the number of edges from the root to the bottommost node

## Challenge
Write an instance method called find-maximum-value. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.

## Approach & Efficiency

### TEST 
Can successfully find the max nuber in the tree

## API
**BinaryTree class**
Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called `preOrder()`, `inOrder()`, and `postOrder()` which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
`find-maximum-value()`.
