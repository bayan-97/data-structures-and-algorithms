# tree
- Node - A node is the individual item/data that makes up the data structure Root - The root is the first/top Node in the tree Left Child - The node that is positioned to the left of a root or node Right Child - The node that is positioned to the right of a root or node Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not contain any children Height - The height of a tree is determined by the number of edges from the root to the bottommost node

## Challenge
1. Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
2. Create a BinaryTree class
3. Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
4. Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be semantic, capturable errors. For example, rather than a default error thrown by your language, your code should raise/throw a custom, semantic error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods you wrote for this lab.

5. Create a BinarySearchTree class
6. Define a method named add that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
7. Define a method named contains that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

## Approach & Efficiency

### TEST 
Can successfully instantiate an empty tree
Can successfully instantiate a tree with a single root node
Can successfully add a left child and right child to a single root node
Can successfully return a collection from a preorder traversal
Can successfully return a collection from an inorder traversal
Can successfully return a collection from a postorder traversal

## API
**BinaryTree class**
Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called `preOrder()`, `inOrder()`, and `postOrder()` which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

**BinarySearchTree class**

Define a method named `add()` that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
Define a method named `contains()` that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
