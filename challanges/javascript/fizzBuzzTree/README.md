# tree
- Node - A node is the individual item/data that makes up the data structure Root - The root is the first/top Node in the tree Left Child - The node that is positioned to the left of a root or node Right Child - The node that is positioned to the right of a root or node Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not contain any children Height - The height of a tree is determined by the number of edges from the root to the bottommost node

## Challenge
Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a k-ary tree as an argument.
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:
If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.

## Approach & Efficiency

### TEST 
If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz” (3 ms)
    ✓ If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
    ✓ If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz””
    ✓ If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String
