# Reverse an Array


The reverse() method reverses an array in place. The first array element becomes the last, and the last array element becomes the first.


## Challenge
You will Make function take array of number and return an array with elements in reversed order.


## Approach & Efficiency

Create function to take one parameter
Array of number 
2- by use reversed 
Method array 
because it is easy way to solve this challange

# arrayShift an Array 




## Challenge
You will make function take array of number and value to be added. return an array with the new value added at the middle index.



## Approach & Efficiency

1- find midindex by array. Length / 2;
2-Inter for loop if index== midindex then push the value after push array[i]
3-And continues to  push another element
