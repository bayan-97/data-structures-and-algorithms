# Hashtables

Hashtables are a data structure that utilize key value pairs. This means every Node or Bucket has both a key, and a value.
## Challenge
**add this method to the hashtable**
add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.

## Approach & Efficiency
### TEST 
   ✓  inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.  
    ✓ Retrieving based on a key returns the value stored 
    ✓ Successfully returns null for a key that does not exist in the hashtable 
    ✓ Successfully retrieve a value from a bucket within the hashtable that has a collision
