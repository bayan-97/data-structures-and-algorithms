# BREATH
- Node - A node is the individual item/data that makes up the data structure Root - The root is the first/top Node in the tree Left Child - The node that is positioned to the left of a root or node Right Child - The node that is positioned to the right of a root or node Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not contain any children Height - The height of a tree is determined by the number of edges from the root to the bottommost node

## Challenge
Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. 
 and return a list of the values in the tree in the 
order they were encountered.

## Approach & Efficiency

### TEST 
Can successfullyreturn a list of the values in the tree in the order they were encountered

## API
**BinaryTree class**
Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called `preOrder()`, `inOrder()`, and `postOrder()` which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
`find-maximum-value()`.
`breadth()`
